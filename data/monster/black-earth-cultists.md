# Black Earth Cultists

Murderers, lunatics, hateful nihilists---these are the sort of people drawn to worship the might of Elemental Evil. The followers of evil elemental earth call themselves the Cult of the Black Earth, and dream of the day when earthquakes reduce the world of mortals to rubble. They seek to recruit evil or destructive monsters that burrow or dwell in the ground, and in fact emulate subterranean creatures to the greatest extent possible, using burrowing magic to carve out their hidden lairs.

Black Earth cultists are slow to act, but when they do, they are utterly implacable. They are single-minded and stubborn, working tirelessly to undermine their enemies. They get along well with the Cult of the Crushing Wave, but they hate the Howling Hatred cult---elemental air is fickle and insubstantial compared to the power of elemental earth.
