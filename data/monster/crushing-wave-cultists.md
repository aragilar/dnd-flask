# Crushing Wave Cultists

The Cult of the Crushing Wave venerates the element of water as a force of destruction and evil. Only fools or lunatics worship the idea of destruction, and many of the Crushing Wave cultists can be described as such. Others are more calculating and deliberate in their evil, and see the power of Elemental Evil as a tool by which they can sweep away the existing order of things and make themselves rulers over all.

While the Crushing Wave cultists take in many people who are bitter, lost, or mad, they also seek alliances with evil or destructive sea creatures. They perform rites designed to sink ships, cause terrible floods, or summon destructive rainstorms, seeking to make all who live nearby bow to the power of elemental water. Cult lairs usually feature great pools or lakes, where devotees use water-breathing magic to immerse themselves in the element they worship.

Crushing Wave cultists embrace a philosophy of elusiveness, patience, and opportunism. They are quick to retreat when challenged, but soon return to strike again. They admire the patience and endurance of the Black Earth cult, but despise the Cult of the Eternal Flame. They see the followers of elemental fire as reckless and short-tempered.
