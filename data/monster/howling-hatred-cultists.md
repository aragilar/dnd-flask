# Howling Hatred Cultists

Most air cultists are idealists lured to the cult by lofty notions such as detachment from material possessions, bodily addictions, and physical desires. Some find their way to the cult in pursuit of rumors that they can learn to fly, tame the wind, or shed their obesity. Whatever their reasons, they eventually succumb to the cult's subtle indoctrination, surrendering their worldly goods to the cult's coffers and the hardiness of their bodies to the cult's emaciating rites. Cultists that survive their initiation usually gain all the things the cult promised at the cost of their free will.

The Cult of the Howling Hatred relies upon deception and trickery both to recruit its members and defeat its enemies. Even so, those that underestimate the air cult for their mysticism shouldn't forget the wild destructive power the cultists wield when they unleash cyclones and tornadoes.

The Cult of Howling Hatred cooperates with the fire and water cults but they loathe the Cult of the Black Earth, viewing its members as stubborn, unenlightened drones without vision or imagination.
