# Eternal Flame Cultists

It is often said that fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. So too it is with the Eternal Flame cultists. Low-ranking members of the cult love the destructive power of fire. The cult leaders harness fire to cleanse their surroundings of anything impure and anyone who's insufficiently dedicated to the cause.

It's perhaps too facile to say that those who follow elemental fire are pyromaniacs who were obsessed with flame as children, but there's a grain of truth behind the stereotype. Eternal Flame cultists are fascinated with fire of all sorts and sometimes stare into a torch for several minutes, carefully studying each flicker of flame. Many have an experimental streak, eager to see what happens when something---a barrel of pitch, a hunter's cabin, an annoying merchant---is set ablaze.

Like the flames they adore, Eternal Flame cultists are quick to act. In a fight, they rarely take prisoners or retreat; they strive to be like an ever-advancing wildfire as they march forward. More broadly, they favor the direct approach and the simple plan to more oblique machinations. That's one reason they loathe the cultists of elemental water, with all their supposed subtleties and ruses. Often it's better put the target to the torch, then sift through the ashes afterward.
