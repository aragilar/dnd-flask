He holds nothing but contempt for mortals (or any other denizens of the Material Plane) and desires nothing more than to crush and subjugate whomever he encounters. What he can't crush, he endures and outlasts.",

He notices each nugget of gold or raw gemstone removed from areas under his influence, seeking to reclaim treasures \"stolen\" from him---and to punish the thieves. When the Prince of Evil Earth gains access to the Material Plane through an elemental node, he begins to methodically locate and destroy every mine, quarry, town, or fortification in the area. It's not that he needs the wealth, but the principle of the thing---extracting treasure from the earth---is anathema to Ogremoch.",
