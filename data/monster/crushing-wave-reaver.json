Crushing Wave reavers appreciate the value of stealth and surprise, and look for chances to launch sudden attacks from positions of concealment whenever possible. The soldiers of the Crushing Wave cult are highly loyal to the cult priests, but they rarely fight to the death if an avenue of retreat is open to them.",
