        "The first gas spores are thought to have been from dead beholders, whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since adapted into a unique plant creature, a gas spore grows quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen of the Underdark.",

        "***Eye Tyrant's Form.*** A gas spore is a spherical, balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a distance, though its true nature becomes.increasingly obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses a blind central \"eye\" and rhizome growths sprouting from its upper surface, superficially resembling a beholder's eyestalks.",
        "",
        "***Death Burst.*** A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does. Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.",
        "",
        "***Beholder Memories.*** A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any creature that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or more of the beholder's fragmented memories, and might gain useful information about the beholder's former lair and other nearby places and creatures of interest."
