A helmed horror follows its orders with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to understand the difference between an order's intent and its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.",

However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active measures to improve its defensive position.",
