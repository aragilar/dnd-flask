Once emptied, a cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually be reheated-before it can be used again. It takes three actions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it.\n\nCauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as acid or green slime, with different effects.\n\n**Boiling Oil.** The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a 10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
