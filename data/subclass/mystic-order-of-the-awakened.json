If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long ago it was last handled.",

For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn."

You can impose disadvantage on a target's saving throw against a discipline or talent you use, but at the cost of using your psychic focus. Your focus immediately ends, and you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus."
