        "By taking up the Seeker path, you are drawn into the unknown wilds far from civilization in search of lost treasures, forgotten evil, and sites of primal magic. You understand that the trackless wilderness can harbor many secrets. Some of those secrets-such as a lonely oasis providing water to a desert realm-must be protected. Others-such as an ancient idol infused with the foul magic of the demon worshippers who crafted it-must be destroyed before their evil awakens once more.",
