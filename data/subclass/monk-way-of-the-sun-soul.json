        "The Sun Soul monks follow a monastic tradition that they believe has its roots in the ancient empire of Netheril. In their philosophy, living things harbor a fragment of the sun's mystic essence within them. Just as the body has a shadow, so too does the spirit have a light. That light is called the sun soul. Brothers and sisters of the Order of the Sun Soul train to tap into the \"spiritual light within\" and manifest it as supernatural feats of prowess and endurance. Members of this order follow the Way of the Sun Soul, which is described in the \"Monastic Traditions\" section below.",
        "",
        "To get in touch with their internal light, Sun Soul monks follow a strict code of ascetic conduct called the Precepts of Incandescence. It emphasizes three pillars:",
        "",
        "**Seek physical perfection.** To open the way for the sun soul to manifest, one should strive to make the body beautiful. Fitness, cleanliness, and well-honed physicality create a clearer window through which the light can shine.",
        "",
        "**Seek spiritual virtue.** Recognize the light in others, not just the darkness. Grant and take each new chance to be virtuous.",
        "",
        "**Shine light into darkness.** Share the soul's light with the world. Light up dark places with your presence and banish shadow.",
        "",
        "Due to the precepts' similarity to the teachings of some faiths, the Order of the Sun Soul has long had associations with temples a nd the faithful of three particular deities: Sune, Sel\u00fbne, and Lathander. The dictate to seek physical perfection and recognize hidden virtue has similarity to Sune's teachings about physical and spiritual beauty. Followers of Sel\u00fbne recognize their goddess's exhortation to battle darkness and seek virtue. And of course, Lathander's association with the sun links to the Sun Soul philosophy, but more critically for worshipers of Lathander, they see the idea of granting and taking new chances as similar to Lathander's emphasis on new beginnings.",
        "",
        "Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature."
