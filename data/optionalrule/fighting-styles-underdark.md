UA-UNDERDARK
# Fighting Styles: Underdark

Both of these options are available to Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers.

***Close Quarters Shooter***

*Unearthed Arcana: Underdark*

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

***Tunnel Fighter***

*Unearthed Arcana: Underdark*

You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.
