# Spell Points

One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead of spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.

In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin or ranger, halve the character's level in that class and the consult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or rogue (Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that class by three.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.

## Other Rules

### Arcane Recovery and Natural Recovery

Instead of recovering levels of spell slots, you regain a number of spell points equal to your level in the relevant class (minimum of 2).

### Expert Divination

When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot you regain a number of spell points equal to the cost of a spell slot one level lower than the slot used to cast the spell, up to a maximum of 7 points.

### Font of Magic

When creating a spell slot using Font of Magic the slot created then turns into a number of spell points based on the level of the spell slot. Alternatively sorcery points can be converted into spell points directly, with 1 sorcery point converting to 1 spell point. Up to 7 sorcery points can be converted at a time in this manner.

When converting a spell slot to sorcery points, a spell slot is created using spell points, as shown in the table above, and the spell slot is converted into a number of sorcery points equal to the level of the spell slot.

### Pact Magic and Mystic Arcanum

Pact Magic and Mystic Arcanum are unchanged by spell points.

### High Magic Epic Boon

You gain an additional 13 spell points and can create a second 9th-level spell slot between long rests.

### Pearl of Power Magic Item

You regain spell points equal to the cost of the highest level spell slot you can create, up to a maximum of 3rd level.
