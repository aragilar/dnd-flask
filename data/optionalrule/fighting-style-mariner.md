***Mariner***

*Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne*

As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Whether a buccaneer, an experienced sailor, or a specially trained marine, a mariner can scale a ship's rigging and swim through choppy water with ease. Adapted to wearing light and medium armor, mariners can defend themselves without relying on heavy armor or bulky shields. Most of them thus wield two-handed weapons or fight with a pair of blades.
