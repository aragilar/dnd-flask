# Modern Rules

## Warlock Pact Boon

**Arcane Gunslinger**  
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature*

You can create a pact weapon that is a sidearm or long arm, and you can transform a magical sidearm or long arm into your pact weapon.

## Ability Checks and Hacking Tools

Most characters in a modern campaign setting are well versed in using computers, and are automatically successful when employing technology for mundane tasks (searching) a hard drive or the Internet, using the normal functions of an electronic device, and so on. For especially challenging technological tasks (finding hidden information on a computer, restoring information from a device that's been erased, and so on), a character makes an Intelligence check against a DC set by the DM. However, some technical tasks-including breaking into protected computer systems, accessing hidden functions of electronic devices, or using a device in a way it was not designed for-require the use of specialized hacking tools.

**Hacking Tools.** This kit contains the hardware and software necessary to allow access into most computer systems and electronic devices. Proficiency with hacking tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence checks you make to connect to or make use of a computer system or electronic device. The kit fits snugly in a backpack or toolbox.

## Armor

The Dungeon Master's Guide provides optional rules for firearms in D&D-including modern and even futuristic weapons. However, this left me in a quandary regarding character defenses. In a typical fantasy setting, adventurers, guards, and other possible combatants are fully expected to wear armor. There are no social penalties when characters are observed in full armor while going about their business. Modern settings are a different animal in this regard.

Using the old d20 Modern Core Rulebook as a guide, and tweaking the math for fifth edition, I created armor options for my "5e Modern" campaign. Because it can be assumed that most characters operate undercover, incognito, or simply in an unobtrusive manner for at least part of the time, I made sure that those options included concealable armor. More obvious armor-whether riot armor, flak jackets, or Land Warrior milspec armor-will likely have an affect on characters' social ability checks and their ability to move freely in your campaign. By that same token, armor might afford bonuses to Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

**Modern Armor**

| Armor | Armor Class (AC) | Strength | Stealth | Properties | Weight
|:------|:-----------------|:---------|:--------|:-----------|:------
| *Light Armor*
| &emsp; Heavy coat | 11 + Dex modifier | - | Disadvantage | - | 6 lb.
| &emsp; Leather jacket | 11 + Dex modifier | - | - | - | 4 lb.
| &emsp; Light Undercover shirt | 11 + Dex modifier | - | - | DR/2 ballistic | 2 lb.
| &emsp; Kevlar-lined coat | 12 + Dex modifier | - | - | DR/2 ballistic | 8 lb.
| &emsp; Undercover vest | 13 + Dex modifer | - | - | DR/2 ballistic | 3 lb.
| *Medium Armor*
| &emsp; Concealable vest | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | - | DR/3 ballistic | 4 lb.
| &emsp; Light-duty vest | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | - | DR/3 ballistic | 8 lb.
| &emsp; Tactical vest | 15 + Dex modifier (max 2) | Str 10 | Disadvantage | Resistance: ballistic | 10 lb.
| *Heavy Armor*
| &emsp; Special response vest | 15 | Str 10 | Disadvantage | Resistance: ballistic | 15 lb.
| &emsp; Land Warrior armor | 17 | Str 13 | Disadvantage | DR/5 ballistic/slashing | 10 lb.
| &emsp; Forced entry unit | 18 | Str 13 | Disadvantage | Resistance: ballistic/slashing | 20 lb.

As you can see from the table, many of the heavier armors grant damage reduction (DR) or resistance to several damage types, including a new damage type: ballistic damage. In game terms, ballistic damage is the type of damage that firearms inflict, and is a subset of piercing damage. This means that all ballistic damage counts as piercing damage, but not all piercing damage counts as ballistic damage. Magical effects or creature properties that grant resistance to piercing damage also apply to ballistic damage, but effects or properties reducing ballistic damage do not automatically apply to piercing damage.

(Armor in my game currently has no price because my modern ruleset uses a wealth system for characters, similar to that used in d20 Modern. Characters gain equipment based on their wealth, rather than tracking income and expenses. I won't get into the full system here, but it might make a good topic for a later installment of Behind the Screens.)

## Firearms

Because of the high potential damage granted to firearms, it was also necessary to introduce a complication or condition in order to balance their use with more traditional modes of attack. In my campaign, a character proficient with a firearm does not automatically add any proficiency bonus to the attack roll. Rather, proficiency with a firearm allows a character to use a bonus action to take the aim action, which adds the character's proficiency bonus to the attack roll. Without taking the aim action (or if a character is using a firearm without proficiency), the shooter receives only the benefit of a Dexterity bonus on the attack roll.

When it came to weapon proficiencies, I decided that several classes would enjoy proficiency with firearms, while others would have to earn their proficiency with multiclassing or by training through the use of downtime days (see the Player's Handbook). I divided firearms into two basic classes: sidearms (for anything up to a submachine gun) and long arms (for anything up to a light machine gun.) Anything heavier-such as a heavy machine gun, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, or a flamethrower-is given special dispensation according to the in-game situation. In my own campaign, I created a feat called Heavy Weapon Specialist that allows proficiency in all modern weapons heavier than a medium machine gun wielded by an unassisted individual on foot. I also made this feat available as a fighting style for the fighter class.

**Firearm Proficiencies by Class**

| Bard      | Sidearms
| Cleric    | None (sidearms available to city domain and any domain granting martial weapon proficiency)
| Druid     | None
| Fighter   | Long arms and sidearms
| Monk      | Sidearms, which are considered monk weapons for this class
| Paladin   | Long arms and sidearms
| Ranger    | Long arms and sidearms
| Rogue     | Long arms or sidearms, pick one
| Sorcerer  | None
